# rhythmbox-discord

Discord RPC for rhythmbox.

Needs `discord-rich-presence` `dbus-native` and probably `discord.js` but idk im sure you're smart, go figure it out.

Then just run `node discord_frienly.js` and you're cool and good. (Yes frienly)
## Selfbot version 
Don't use this one unless you have to. Self bots are bad.
Needs `ruby-dbus` gem and `discordrb`.

Make a config.yaml file that looks like:
```yaml
client_id: your id
token: your token
prefix: idk why i still have this
owner: your id but idk why i still have this
```
