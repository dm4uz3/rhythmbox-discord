# rhythmbox-discord
Discord selfbot for setting now playing status w/ rhythmbox
Make a config.yaml file that looks like:
```yaml
client_id: your id
token: your token
prefix: idk why i still have this
owner: your id but idk why i still have this
```

needs `ruby-dbus` gem and `discordrb`

## RPC Version
Because dm4 doesn't like self bots. Lots of bugs, but it works:tm:
needs `discord-rich-presence` and probably `discord.js` but idk im sure you're smart go figure it out
