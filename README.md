# rhythmbox-discord

Discord RPC for rhythmbox.

needs `discord-rich-presence` `dbus-native` and probably `discord.js` but idk im sure you're smart go figure it out

Then just run `node discord_friendly.js` and you're cool and good.
## Selfbot version 
Don't use this one unless you have to. Self bots are bad.
needs `ruby-dbus` gem and `discordrb`

Make a config.yaml file that looks like:
```yaml
client_id: your id
token: your token
prefix: idk why i still have this
owner: your id but idk why i still have this
```
